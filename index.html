          <h3>ABOUT</h3>
          <p>
            I have always looked for opportunities to build, be creative and to
            self-improve, through education. Since focusing exploring and
            pursuing a career in software development, Iâ€™m happy to say I find
            these opportunities every day. As a recording artist and music
            producer my intrigue was sparked by a desire to innovate and
            problem-solve and technology has opened many more avenues for
            exploring these passions.
            <br /><br />
            As a developer, I prioritise communication and attention to detail
            and believe an open-minded attitude and a search engine can solve
            any problem eventually.
